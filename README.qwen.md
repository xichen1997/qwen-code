# Qwen Code

![Qwen Code Screenshot](./docs/assets/qwen-screenshot.png)

Qwen Code is a command-line AI workflow tool adapted from [**Gemini CLI**](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli) (Please refer to [this document](./README.gemini.md) for more details), optimized for [Qwen3-Coder](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen3-Coder) models with enhanced parser support & tool support.

> [!WARNING]
> Qwen Code may issue multiple API calls per cycle, resulting in higher token usage, similar to Claude Code. We’re actively working to enhance API efficiency and improve the overall developer experience.

## Key Features

- **Code Understanding & Editing** - Query and edit large codebases beyond traditional context window limits
- **Workflow Automation** - Automate operational tasks like handling pull requests and complex rebases
- **Enhanced Parser** - Adapted parser specifically optimized for Qwen-Coder models

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have [Node.js version 20](https://nodejs.org/en/download) or higher installed.

```bash
curl -qL https://www.npmjs.com/install.sh | sh
```

### Installation

```bash
npm install -g @qwen-code/qwen-code
qwen --version
```

Then run from anywhere:

```bash
qwen
```

Or you can install it from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/QwenLM/qwen-code.git
cd qwen-code
npm install
npm install -g .
```

### API Configuration

Set your Qwen API key (In Qwen Code project, you can also set your API key in `.env` file). the `.env` file should be placed in the root directory of your current project.

> ⚠️ **Notice:** <br>
> **If you are in mainland China, please go to https://bailian.console.aliyun.com/ to apply for your API key** <br>
> **If you are not in mainland China, please go to https://modelstudio.console.alibabacloud.com/ to apply for your API key**

```bash
# If you are in mainland China, use the following URL:
# https://dashscope.aliyuncs.com/compatible-mode/v1
# If you are not in mainland China, use the following URL:
# https://dashscope-intl.aliyuncs.com/compatible-mode/v1
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
export OPENAI_BASE_URL="your_api_base_url_here"
export OPENAI_MODEL="your_api_model_here"
```

## Usage Examples

### Explore Codebases

```sh
cd your-project/
qwen
> Describe the main pieces of this system's architecture
```

### Code Development

```sh
> Refactor this function to improve readability and performance
```

### Automate Workflows

```sh
> Analyze git commits from the last 7 days, grouped by feature and team member
```

```sh
> Convert all images in this directory to PNG format
```

## Popular Tasks

### Understand New Codebases

```text
> What are the core business logic components?
> What security mechanisms are in place?
> How does the data flow work?
```

### Code Refactoring & Optimization

```text
> What parts of this module can be optimized?
> Help me refactor this class to follow better design patterns
> Add proper error handling and logging
```

### Documentation & Testing

```text
> Generate comprehensive JSDoc comments for this function
> Write unit tests for this component
> Create API documentation
```
